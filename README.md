# automatic-pancakes

Please find below the link to the automatic-pancakes final Google Colab Notebook, this AI will require very little user expertise and can be very powerful, with little requirements as far as PC specs.
In total the Notebook takes around five minutes to run from start to finish and requires very little user input.
It is default set to run off of the model of pygmalion-6b_dev-4bit-128g, please note that this does take up a decent amount of storage dependant on the google drive (exact figure dependant on model) 
and so may exceed free storage limits

Please find the link to it here :)
